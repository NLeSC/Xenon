Portable workflows through abstraction with Xenon<br />
Portable HPC workflows with Snakemake and Xenon</p>
<p>workflow to do <something important> using 4 reference tools.<br />
each tool requires its own dependencies/environment.<br />
we solved the environments problem using conda<br />
we wrote down the steps of the workflow in a snakemake recipe<br />
conda gives us the environment (either as virtual environment or through the use of containers)<br />
snakemake ties everything together in the right order</p>
<p>we wanted to run the workflow on several data sets<br />
what made this challenging was that the data could not be moved due to privacy reasons.<br />
so needed to do the analysis using on-premises compute infrastructure<br />
problem: the development compute infrastructures differs from production: SLURM vs. GE clusters</p>
<p>two ways forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>DRMAA (why do we not want this?)</li>
<li>scheduler-specific commands with conda's cluster option<br />
new, 3rd way<br />
we solved the distributed-computing problem using xenon-cli</li>
</ol>
