{"name":"Octopus","tagline":"Library to interface with different distributed compute and storage resources","body":"![logo](http://nlesc.github.io/octopus/images/NLeSC_Octopus_logo.png)\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 The Netherlands eScience Center\r\n\r\nLast modified: 26 August 2013\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nOctopus is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple programming \r\ninterface to various pieces of software that can be used to access distributed\r\ncompute and storage resources. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Octopus?\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOctopus is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support library \r\nfor our projects. Several projects develop end-user applications that require \r\naccess to distributed compute and storage resources. Octopus provides a simple \r\nAPI to those resources, allowing those applications to be developed more \r\nrapidly. The experience gained during end-user application development is used \r\nto improve the Octopus API and implementation. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Latest Version\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nDetails of the latest version can be found on the octopus project web site at\r\n<https://github.com/NLeSC/octopus>.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nFor an overview of octopus please consult the __online users guide__:\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/NLeSC/octopus/blob/develop/doc/userguide.md>\r\n\r\nA pdf version of the user guide is also available in the docs directory \r\n\"docs/usersguide.pdf\" or online at:\r\n\r\n<http://nlesc.github.io/octopus/userguide.pdf>\r\n\r\nSee the file \"INSTALL.txt\" for a description of how to install octopus. \r\n\r\nThe javadoc of octopus library is available online at: \r\n\r\n<http://nlesc.github.io/octopus/javadoc>\r\n\r\nThe source of octopus can be found in \"src/\".
